## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security

- Always verify the authenticity of the package by checking the official GitHub repository
- Use the installation methods described in the official documentation
- Consider using virtual environments to isolate the application

### API Key Protection

If you are using sensitive API keys with Llamaduck Pro:

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secure credential storage
- Rotate API keys regularly according to your organization's security policies

## Security Design Principles

The Llamaduck Pro project follows these security principles:

1. **No Storage of Sensitive Data**: Llamaduck Pro doesn't store user search data or credentials locally beyond the current session.
2. **Secure Communications**: All API requests are made over HTTPS.
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: We maintain a lean dependency tree to minimize potential vulnerability surfaces.
4. **Regular Updates**: We regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches.

## Security Measures

- Automated dependency scanning through GitHub Dependabot
- Regular code reviews with security focus
- Continuous Integration tests that include security checks
